# AI & Token system
 This project is made for my portfolio and includes two minor projects bunched together. 
 An AI completely written in C++ (Behaviour Tree created and assembled in C++ as well) along with a "Token system" to manage the AI's different actions.
 The AI takes inspiration from DOOM with both its behaviour & the token system being used.
